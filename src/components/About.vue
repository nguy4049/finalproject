      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born in upstate New York, Rochester, a good many years ago, and lived there until I was twenty, upon
        which time I decided I wanted to explore the world a bit. I loved to ski and so thought teaching out West
        somewhere would be great fun (it was!) and so I called all the ski schools I could find in the Rocky Mountains
        and the only person who would hire me sight unseen was a lady in Salt Lake City who ran the ski school at
        Brighton Ski Resort. And that's how I ended up in Utah! Among the best ~10 years of my life, to be quite
        honest.</p>

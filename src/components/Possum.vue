    <h1>Possums </h1>
    <h1>They help to maintain a clean and healthy environment;
      Nature’s gently and quiet little Sanitation Engineers!</h1>
    <h1> In the ecosystem, if you trap or relocate opossums, they
      WILL be replaced by less desirable animals, such as RACCOONS!</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>Facts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Opossums	are	native	to	North	America.		The	most	common	is	the	Virginia	Opossum.		The	only	marsupial	(pouched
        mammal)	found	in	the	United	States	and	Canada. </li>
      <li>Often,	fear	or	dislike	is	based	on	misinformation.	We	hope	that	more	people	can	learn	to	live	in	harmony	with	these
        often	misunderstood	animals.</li>
      <li>Opossum	DO	NOT	DIG	INTO	SOIL, DOES	NOT	DIG	UP	YOUR	FLOWER	BULBS,	NO	CHEWING	TELEPHONE	OR
        ELECTRICAL	WIRES,	NOR	DO	THEY	DESTROY	PROPERTY. Opossums	are	NOT	the	most	destructive creatures,	they
        have	a	potential	to	make	a	mess. </li>
      <li>Opossums	have	a	naturally	low	body	temperature	and	makes	them	less	susceptible	to	other	diseases	that	can	affect
        wildlife	animals	(such	as	distemper).		The	chance	of	rabies	in	an	opossum	is	EXTREMELY	RARE.	 </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Make Peace with the Opossums</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples	of	common	feeling;	ugly,	mean,	pesky.		A	face	only	a	mother	could	love!	</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Predators</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Opossums	have	a	relatively	short	life	span;	living	an	average	of	three	years.</li>
      <li>Man	is	one	of	the	biggest	predators!		</li>
      <li>Many	are	killed	by	cars,	dogs,	owls,	and	larger	wildlife</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Great Groundkeeper</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If	you	are	lucky	to	have	one	of	these	guys	come	around,	without	cost,	he	is	quietly	cleaning	up	what	he	can	and	will
        move	to	help	someone	else.		He	takes	his	pay	only	what	he	eats,	and	maybe	a	dry	place	to	sleep	before	moving	on.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Shelter</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If	you	have	an	opossum	around	today,	just	be	patient;	he	or	she	will	move	on	shortly!		The	opossum	is	just	merely
        passing	through.		They	are	not	“den”	animals;	they	never	stay	long	in	one	place.		They	are	rarely	used	more	than	a
        couple	of	nights	in	a	row	by	the	same	animal.		A	female	with	young	may	stay	for	longer	periods.		</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Behavior</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Adults	cannot	hang	from	their	tails.		They	do	have	prehensile	tails	which	they	use	to	help	grip	and	balance	when
        climbing	trees.</li>
      <li>Opossums	CANNOT	JUMP	or	RUN;	they	walk	very	fast</li>
      <li>If	one	Opossum	sees	another,	it	will	walk	the	other	way,	so	as	not	to	compete	for	available	food	sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Diet / Natural Pest Contro</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Opossums	are	scavengers.		They	move	from	place	to	place	in	search	of	good	food	sources	and	a	comfy	place	to
        sleep.</li>
      <li>They	are	omnivores;	eat	both	vegetation	and	meat.		In	the	wild,	they	eat	grass,	nuts,	fruit,	mice,	chickens,	wild	birds,
        insects	(including	roaches),	worms,	snails,	slugs,	crickets,	beetles,	ticks,	and	snakes	(including	venomous	ones).		In
        the	city,	they	will	eat	garbage	and	roadkill,	catches	and	eats	rats,	all	of	which	is	helpful	to	keep	diseases	at	bay.		They
        are	beneficial	for	helping	to	control	the	overpopulation	of	snakes,	rodents,	and	insects.</li>
      <li>Opossums	act	like	little	vacuum	cleaners	when	it	comes	to	ticks,	including	those	that	spread	Lyme	disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lyme Disease</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>By	fracturing	habitats	and	disrupting	ecosystems,	humans	have	allowed	the	ticks	that	feed	on	wild	mice	to	flourish
        and	these	intrusions	are	coming	back	to	bite	us.		But	in	places	where	predators	are	scarce,	the	ticks	run	wild.</li>
      <li>A single opossum might kill an astonishing 4,000 ticks in a week.		</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Natural Defenses</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>When	threatened,	opossums	run,	growl,	belch,	urinate,	and	defecate.		When	they	“play	possum”,	and	act	as	if	they
        are	dead,	actually,	the	opossum	has	an	involuntary	comatose-like	state	induced	by	extreme	fear	(so	basically,	they
        faint).		The	body	is	limp	or	stiff,	they	roll	over,	close	their	eyes	(or	stare	off	into	space),	its	front	feet	form	into	balls,
        bare	their	teeth,	and	drool	runs	out	of	its	mouth	or	foams	and	a	foul-smelling	fluid	is	secreted	from	glands.		This
        state	can	last	from	several	minutes	to	several	hours.		Once	the	danger	has	passed,	and	the	opossum	“comes	to”
        again	and	goes	on	his	way.		An	effective	deterrent	to	predators	looking	for	a	hot	meal.</li>
